# Diabetes Risk Predictor

This project predicts diabetes risk using real-world health data and machine learning models, including a PyTorch neural network.

## Features
Perform EDA and handle missing/invalid values
Build a strong preprocessing pipeline with feature engineering
Compare multiple models (LogReg, RF, XGBoost, Neural Net)
Visualize model performance (ROC, AUC, feature importance)
Explain predictions with SHAP
Deploy a live web app with Gradio
